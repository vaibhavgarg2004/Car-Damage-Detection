# Car Damage Detector

An intelligent web application built with Streamlit that automatically detects and classifies vehicle damage from images, helping users, insurers, and car repair professionals quickly assess a car’s condition. By simply uploading a photo of a vehicle (preferably from a third-quarter front or rear view), the app uses a deep learning model to predict the type of damage.

## 🛠 Features  
- Upload a vehicle photo and instantly get a prediction for damage type. 
- Classifies images into 6 target classes:
   - Front Normal
   - Front Crushed
   - Front Breakage
   - Rear Normal
   - Rear Crushed
   - Rear Breakage 
- Uses ResNet50 fine-tuned on a curated car damage dataset.
- Works well on images with varied lighting and angles.
- Simple, fast, and deployable with no backend server required.  
- Lightweight codebase optimized for local or cloud usage.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally  
### Prerequisites:  
- Python 3.8+

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vaibhavgarg2004/Car-Damage-Detector.git
   cd Car-Damage-Detector
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:   
   ```commandline
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the Streamlit app**:   
   ```commandline
    streamlit run app.py
   ```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Image Upload & Display**  
   - The user uploads a car image (JPG/PNG) through the Streamlit interface.
   - The app saves the uploaded file locally (e.g., as a temporary file) and displays it in the app. 

2. **Preprocessing & Model Inference**  
   - The saved image is resized, normalized, and converted to a tensor.  
   - The pre-trained ResNet50 model processes the image to classify it into one of six damage categories. 

3. **Prediction Output**  
   - The predicted damage class is instantly shown in the app interface, allowing users to quickly understand the car’s condition.
